# Stay-Alive-Game(geometry dash)



It's my first game developed using the Unity engine, and it bears a resemblance to Geometry Dash. I've embarked on the challenge of replicating the movement mechanics found in Geometry Dash, which presents a new and exciting hurdle for me. Despite lacking prior knowledge of game development and asset creation, I'm determined to overcome these obstacles and create a compelling game experience. With each step, I'm learning and growing, pushing the boundaries of my abilities to bring this project to life. It's not just about building a game; it's about the journey of discovery and accomplishment along the way.


### Note: this is first version I know it needs modifications and additions and have bugs, but in the future I will edit it and post it.
